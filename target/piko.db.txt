72	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	IEA	f	Evan Howell, evan.howell@noaa.gov\r\nJeffrey Polovina, jeffrey.polovina@noaa.gov	f	The purpose of an IEA is to perform a formal synthesis and quantitative analysis of information on relevant natural and socio-economic factors, specifically in relation to identified ecosystem management goals for a region. The Kona region was a natural choice for this pilot IEA project based on its dynamic ecology and the vast history of research done in this area. Work on several initial scientific research projects was begun in 2010. These include the construction of two ecosystem models for the reef and coastal areas of Kona, the construction of socio-economic indicators for the Kona region, and a project using a circulation model to understand how eddies on the Kona coast may influence larval fish transport and settlement. Another goal for 2011 is to finish the Kona IEA website and a multiyear plan for the PIFSC IEA program.	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Risk and Vulnerability or Problem-focused Regional/Local or Problem-focused Marine and Terrestrial Ecosystems Central North Pacific State of Hawaii	f	Kona Area Integrated Ecosystems Assessment	f	f	f	f	f	t	NOAA/NMFS/Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center	f	f	f	f	f	USGS, NPS, State of Hawaii, University of Hawaii, Oregon State University, IPRC, WPRFMSC, The Kohala Center	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	http://www.pifsc.noaa.gov/kona_iea/	f	f	f	Assessment-Kona_IEA.doc	t

With an initial focus on natural disasters (including climate impacts) and coastal and island communities, the needs assessment targeted respondents in Hawaii Oregon, Washington, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and American Samoa. One of the key findings was that there are significant unmet training needs in the area of natural disasters. The frequency and high profile of recent natural disasters have resulted in a growing concern about natural disaster preparedness, response and recovery among agencies, organizations and the public. A number of respondents noted that the first responders were in reality the citizens who were often ill equipped to deal with the disaster. The top three general unmet training needs were related to natural disaster response, recovery and protection and encompassed a broad spectrum, ranging from awareness, risk assessment, and mitigation to response and recovery. Many advocated the inclusion of non-governmental organizations and the general public in trainings, and to increase training for public communication and awareness of natural disasters.	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	 Needs And Capabilities Needs Capacity Capabilities Risk and Vulnerability or Problem-focused Fresh Water Resources and Drought Coastal Inundation/Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather, and Community Resilience International and National National and Regional Regional/Local or Problem-focused Central North Pacific State of Hawaii Western North Pacific Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) Guam Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) American Samoa South Pacific Completed	f	National Disaster Preparedness Training Center	t	t	t	f	f	f	University of Hawaii, FEMA	f	f	f	f	f	Pacific Risk Management Ohana	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	http://www.durp.hawaii.edu/Disaster%20Management.html	f	t	t	Assessment-NDPTC.doc	t

Hazard risk and vulnerability assessments (RVA), specifically for climate related risks, have been established as an interdisciplinary methodology that underpins the development of disaster risk-reduction plans. The Pacific RISA will review existing disaster risk-reduction plans and assist island governments in updating these plans with the best available climate-related knowledge. Pursued simultaneously, a second component of the RVA involves identifying critical facilities, infrastructure and lifelines; economic infrastructure and employment characteristics; ecosystems that aid in protection; and characteristics of local populations. We will inventory adaptive capacities including: availability of resources, sustainable financing for projects, alternative livelihoods, ecosystem management, institutional frameworks, legal and regulatory instruments, governance, policy implementation, and sector-specific, local, and indigenous knowledge systems. Pacific RISA will develop scenario-planning methods to improve adaptation. Following the baseline characterization of community exposure and resilience, the information can be linked with different hazard risk scenarios that are based on different climate change projections.	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	 Needs And Capabilities Risk and Vulnerability or Problem-focused Capabilities Capacity Regional/Local or Problem-focused Coastal Inundation/Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather, and Community Resilience Central North Pacific State of Hawaii Western North Pacific Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) Guam Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) American Samoa South Pacific Completed	f	Pacific RISA Hazards and Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment	f	f	t	f	f	f	Pacific RISA	f	f	f	f	f	UH SSRI, UH SLC, IPRC, NOAA PEAC, NOAA NWS, UOG, USGS, USDA NRCS	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	http://www.pacificrisa.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=256&Itemid=174	f	f	t	Assessment-PacRISA_HCRVA.doc	t

Pacific Storms is developing an integrated set of extremes indicators and associated inter-annual and annual strong winds, heavy rains, and high seas derived data products. The intent of these products is to delineate the patterns and trends of extremes within and between locations and regions, how they have been expressed historically, and may be expected to be expressed in a changing climate. Much of the information available via this site represents the analysis of historical records by a team of recognized agency and university-based experts in the area of climate-related processes that govern storminess and its expression in the Pacific region. It includes plots delineating things such as the rates of sea level rise and high water return periods; changes in the frequency of both short-lived intense rainfall events and extended periods of heavy rains; and the linkages of these patterns and trends to climate indices.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	 Understanding Climate Variability and Change Understanding Climate Impacts and Informing Adaptation Coastal Inundation/Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather, and Community Resilience Central North Pacific Western North Pacific South Pacific Pacific Basin Products - Physical  Hindcasts (climatologies) Projections (intrannual to multi-decadal) Atmospheric (e.g., Air Temperature, Rainfall, Wind Speed and Direction) Oceanic (e.g., Water Temperature, Salinity, Acidity, Sea Level, Wave Height) Public Health and Safety Fresh Water Resources Transportation/Communication and Commerce Community Planning and Development Agriculture and Fisheries Recreation and Tourism	f	f	f	f	f	f	Pacific Storms Climatology Products	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	NOAA/NCDC, Pacific Climate Information System (PaCIS)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	http://www.pacificstormsclimatology.org/	f	t	f	t	DAP_PSCP.doc	t

The goal is to provide information to planners, managers, and other decision-makers that affords them an opportunity to appropriately address risks from elevated water levels. Extreme water levels are experienced when seasonal high tides combine with intra-annual sea level variations associated with ocean processes (e.g., ENSO, mesoscale eddy events) and surge and/or high run-up due to wind, wave, and atmospheric forces associated with storms. Recent work suggest that not only can stations can be grouped regionally into those where high tides dictate extremes, where the combination of high tides and the nontidal residual is important, and where nontidal residual events are the primary cause of extreme levels, but by the combination of processes that contribute to the nontidal residual (e.g., tropical and extra-tropical storms, ocean mesoscale variability, and swell events from distant storms). This effort is exploring how this knowledge can be used, for example by establishing forecast skill through statistical relationships to teleconnections or other such indices, to create one to three month extreme water level outlooks that are specific to a particular location.	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	 Understanding Climate Variability and Change Coastal Inundation/Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather, and Community Resilience Central North Pacific Western North Pacific South Pacific Pacific Basin Products - Physical  Outloooks (monthly to annual) Impacts Flooding/Inundation Erosion Spatial Scale Location/Site Time Scale Future Methodology Model/Statistical Oceanic (e.g., Water Temperature, Salinity, Acidity, Sea Level, Wave Height) Public Health and Safety Community Planning and Development	f	t	t	f	f	t	Pacific Sea Level Extremes Outlooks Products	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	NOAA/NCDC/Regional Climate Services	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	t	DAP_SLEO.doc	t

The goal is to provide information to planners, managers, and other decision-makers that affords them an opportunity to appropriately address risks from elevated water levels. For sea levels (excluding run-up), extreme value analysis of sea level station records based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) or modified Peak Over Threshold (POT) distributions may currently represent the best attempt to move beyond relatively simplistic SLR/coastal inundation scenarios based on global rate of change projections. However, the tendency has been to assume that the observations are stationary (are not time dependent). Recognizing a changing climate, this effort is building upon the work of recent investigators that have employed other types of statistical or numerical analysis that, for example allow the GEV parameters to be temporal functions (linear, quadratic, exponential, and periodic) or covariates. The appeal of such advanced statistical and numerical techniques it that they may provide a means to generate information that reflects a more nuanced – tailored to the site and situation – portrait of vulnerability of Pacific Islands to risks associated with SLR/coastal inundation.	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	 Understanding Climate Variability and Change Coastal Inundation/Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather, and Community Resilience Central North Pacific Western North Pacific South Pacific Pacific Basin Products - Physical  Outloooks (monthly to annual) Impacts Flooding/Inundation Erosion Spatial Scale Location/Site Time Scale Future Methodology Model/Statistical Oceanic (e.g., Water Temperature, Salinity, Acidity, Sea Level, Wave Height) Public Health and Safety Community Planning and Development	f	t	t	f	f	t	Pacific Sea Level Extremes Scenario Products	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	NOAA/NCDC/Regional Climate Services	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	http://www.pacificstormsclimatology.org/	f	t	f	t	DAP_SLES.doc	t

The goal is to provide information to planners, managers, and other decision-makers that affords them an opportunity to appropriately address risks from elevated water levels. Extreme water levels are experienced when seasonal high tides combine with intra-annual sea level variations associated with ocean processes (e.g., ENSO, mesoscale eddy events) and surge and/or high run-up due to wind, wave, and atmospheric forces associated with storms. Recent work suggest that not only can stations can be grouped regionally into those where high tides dictate extremes, where the combination of high tides and the nontidal residual is important, and where nontidal residual events are the primary cause of extreme levels, but by the combination of processes that contribute to the nontidal residual (e.g., tropical and extra-tropical storms, ocean mesoscale variability, and swell events from distant storms). This effort is exploring how this knowledge can be used, for example by establishing forecast skill through statistical relationships to teleconnections or other such indices, to create one to three month extreme water level outlooks that are specific to a particular location.	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	 Central North Pacific Western North Pacific South Pacific Pacific Basin Oceanic (e.g., Water Temperature, Salinity, Acidity, Sea Level, Wave Height) Coastal Flooding/Erosion Location/Site Specific (Point) Future One month Three months In-Situ Observations Statistical Model Public Health and Safety Community Planning and Development	f	Pacific Sea Level Extremes Outlooks Products	f	f	t	f	NOAA/NCDC/Regional Climate Services	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	t	Outlooks_PSLE.doc	t	f

The MJO is the major fluctuation in tropical weather on weekly to monthly timescales. The MJO can be characterized as an eastward moving pulse of cloud and rainfall near the equator that typically recurs every 30 to 60 days. MJO effects are most evident over the Indian Ocean and western equatorial Pacific. It influences the timing, development and strength of the major global monsoon patterns, including the Indian and Australian monsoons. Tropical cyclones are also more likely to develop in association with certain phases of a strong MJO event.

Complex dynamical models project the evolution of the tropical Pacific Ocean from its currently observed state. Statistical forecast models can also capture some of the precursors of such developments. Expert analysis of the current situation adds further value, especially in interpreting the implications of the evolving situation below the ocean surface. All forecast methods try to incorporate the effects of ocean-atmosphere interactions within the climate system. The meteorological and oceanographic data that allow El Nino and La Nina episodes to be monitored and forecast are drawn from national and international observing systems. The exchange and processing of the data are carried out under programmes coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization.\r\n	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	 Central North Pacific Western North Pacific South Pacific Pacific Basin Atmospheric (e.g., Air Temperature, Rainfall, Wind Speed and Direction) Oceanic (e.g., Water Temperature, Salinity, Acidity, Sea Level, Wave Height) Drought Heavy Rainfall/Stream Flooding/Mass Wasting  Coral Bleaching/Ecosystem Impacts (e.g., Marine) Region/Nation (Grid) Future Six months or more Three months Statistical Model Dynamical Model Fresh Water Resources Ecosystems Agriculture and Fisheries	f	El Nino/La Nina Update	f	f	t	f	WMO	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcasp/documents/WMO_ENSO_Feb12_Eng.pdf	f	t	Outlooks_ENLNU.doc	t	f

This involves a Pacific-wide rod surface accretion table (RSET) network that quantifies the rate at which mangroves are rising or falling in relation to sea level rise. This information is also being used to help secure C credits, which can be used to restore of conserve these valuable ecosystems. We are also quantifying accretion rates using naturally occurring 210Pb and 137Cs.

This balance is being altered by climate change, with important implications for terrestrial carbon storage and, hence, atmospheric CO2 levels and global climate. However, the response of terrestrial carbon cycling to warming remains poorly quantified, especially in the tropics. This is particularly important because tropical forests account for a ~40% of global terrestrial carbon storage and ~35% of global terrestrial productivity and, as such, tropical forests play a very important role in regulating global climate. This study is examining how rising mean annual temperature will impact carbon input, allocation, loss, and storage in native Hawaiian wet forests along a 5.2°C mean annual temperature gradient. Results from the research along this model ecological gradient will enhance capacity to predict how terrestrial ecosystems, in particular tropical forests, will respond to warming over the next century.	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	t	 Understanding Climate Variability and Change Research/Development Training and Capacity Building, Education, Outreach Surface (e.g., temp, precip, wind) (e.g., surface water, glaciers and ice caps, land cover, biomass) Intra-annual to Decadal Understanding Climate Impacts and Informing Adaptation Climate Impacts Research/Development Climate Adaptation Training and Capacity Building, Education, Outreach Assessment and Evaluation Policies and Legislation Agriculture and Fisheries Ecosystems Marine and Terrestrial Ecosystems Ongoing State of Hawaii Central North Pacific Global	f	f	Impacts of Rising Mean Annual Temperature on Terrestrial Carbon Cycling in Model Forests	f	f	We are estimating carbon input (net photosynthetic carbon gain, or ‘gross primary production’ (GPP)), carbon loss (soil respiration and aboveground plant respiration), carbon partitioning (fraction of GPP that goes towards production vs. respiration in foliage, aboveground wood, and belowground), and ecosystem carbon storage (live aboveground and belowground biomass, forest floor, coarse woody debris, and mineral soil organic matter to ~1 m depth).

Most recent update Winter 2011. 2) The formulation of new integrated and/or regional climate indices. On-going.\r\n	Pacific Storms is focused on improving our understanding of patterns and trends of storm frequency and intensity - storminess - within the Pacific region. It is exploring how the climate-related processes that govern extreme storm events are expressed within and between three thematic areas: heavy rains, strong winds, and high seas. It is developing a suite of extremes climatology-related data and information products that can be used by emergency managers, mitigation planners, government agencies and decision-makers in key sectors including water and natural resource management, agriculture and fisheries, transportation and communication, and recreation and tourism. In-situ station products include the delineation of rates of sea level rise and high water return periods, as well as changes in the frequency of both short-lived intense rainfall events and extended periods of heavy rains and the linkages of these patterns and trends to climate indices.  Observational data used to support product development are taken from standard holdings. In addition to the basic product set, special attention is being given to climate indices-related products that describe the relationship between extremes and climate, primarily through the correlation of extremes indicators and climate indices known to have relevance to the Pacific region (e.g., the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI); the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO); the North Pacific Index (NPI); etc.) as well as the formulation of new integrated and/or regional indices.	f	t	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	•\tInformal and formal requests for review and comment from users at various stages in the process.\r\n1) Presentations and publications. 2) Regular project planning meetings with the project team. 3) Observed user response, including website hits and requests for information. 4) Number, type, geographic extent of stations/products.     \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Understanding Climate Variability and Change Observing Systems, Data Stewardship, Data Services Operational Products and Services Research/Development Historical Observations (hindcasts/climatologies) Surface (e.g., temp, precip, wind) Surface (e.g., SST, SSH, salinity, ocean color) Intra-annual to Decadal Multi-decadal (scenarios) Ongoing Fresh Water Resources and Drought Coastal Inundation/Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather, and Community Resilience Marine and Terrestrial Ecosystems Central North Pacific Western North Pacific South Pacific Pacific Basin	f	f	Pacific Storms Climatology Products	f	f	Users are able to explore how extreme events have been expressed historically and may be expected to be expressed in a changing climate.

The ultimate outcome of this effort will be a reduction in the vulnerability to the economic, social, and environmental risks associated with coastal storms, as decision-makers in the Pacific Islands are provided with high quality science-based information that enables them to understand, anticipate, and adapt to risks associated with coastal storm-related extreme events in the context of a changing climate: 1) A broad suite of in-situ station and remotely-sensed derived-data products for much of the Pacific Basin; and 2) The formulation of new integrated and/or regional climate indices.\r\n	t	NOAA/NCDC/Regional Climate Services	f	f	f	t	f	f	Pacific Storms is a collaborate effort involving a group of recognized agency and university-based experts in the area of climate-related processes that govern storminess.

Students and citizens within the region will have the knowledge and skills to advance understanding of climate change, and to adapt to its impacts. Core PCEP partners contribute expertise in climate science, the science of learning, the region’s education infrastructure, and the region’s cultures and indigenous knowledge and practices. PCEP’s interactive web-based environment interlinks the region’s locations, organizations and people with information about climate science and climate impacts.

The research phase, spanning March 2011 – May 2011 encompassed an initial literature review, interviews with local decision-makers, developing an outline for the written product, and drafting sections of the final report. The writing phase took place over the course of May 2011 – August 2011 and culminated in a final draft to be sent to reviewers in August. Outreach included workshops for stakeholders and legislators in October 2011 - November 2011 to release and publicize the findings and to develop action strategies for implementing the recommendations.	The goal of the Center for Island Climate Adaptation and Policy Sea-level Rise Policy Study project was to increase community resiliency to the climate impacts of sea-level rise. Building on the scientific research of Dr. Charles Fletcher, this project incorporated input from state decision-makers as it identified best practices and policy options for adaptation. The project was unique in its iterative methodology, specifically designed to engage decision-makers and incorporate their feedback at multiple points throughout the process of developing adaptation strategies and policy tools.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	The project is unique in its iterative methodology, specifically designed to engage decision-makers and incorporate their feedback at multiple points throughout the process of developing adaptation strategies and policy tools.

The goal of this proposed effort is to use GCM and coupled numerical wave model output to provide 3-hourly data and statistical measures (mean and top 5% values) of wave height, wave period, wave direction, wind speed, and wind direction for 15 DOI-managed coastal assets (parks and refuges) in the Pacific Ocean for the recent past (1996-2005) and future projections (2026-2045 and 2085-2100). These data are needed as baseline physical information for these DOI-managed assets, as winds and waves are the dominant spatially- and temporally-varying processes that influence coastal morphology and ecosystem structure, and can impact coastal infrastructure, natural and cultural resources, and coastal-related economic activities (e.g., fishing and tourism).	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Understanding Climate Variability and Change Research/Development Historical Observations (hindcasts/climatologies) Projections (modeling and downscaling) Seasonal (outlook) Intra-annual to Decadal Multi-decadal (scenarios) Surface (e.g., temp, precip, wind) Surface (e.g., SST, SSH, salinity, ocean color) Ongoing Coastal Inundation/Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather, and Community Resilience Western North Pacific Guam Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) Central North Pacific State of Hawaii Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Pacific Remote Islands American Samoa South Pacific Pacific Basin	f	f	Future Wind and Wave Projections for NPS and USFWS Managed Islands in the Pacific	f	t	This proposed effort would generate two general types of products: mean and extreme (top 5%) monthly statistics for wave height, wave period, wave direction, wind speed, and wind direction for each of the 15 study locations (Niihau, Hawaii, Midway Atoll, Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, Kwajalein, Rose Atoll, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Atoll.

The goal of this study is to provide maps of wave impact and storm-induced inundation levels for islands of high conservation value. Vulnerability will be assessed for Midway Atoll and Laysan Island using historical data and new high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for a variety of sea-level rise scenarios. Research to date forecasts sea-level rise with only passive flooding scenarios, and until now, was limited by a lack of topography data for Hawaii’s remote atolls. Predicting impacts of flooding and storm-induced waves is needed to develop climate-change adaptation plans for the biological communities and resident endangered species. This information is also needed for managers to understand risks and determine emergency responses for the range of parameters where natural, historical, and cultural resources and remotely stationed personnel may be threatened from sea-level rise and storm-induced waves.	t	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	 Understanding Climate Variability and Change Research/Development Projections (modeling and downscaling) Surface (e.g., temp, precip, wind) Surface (e.g., SST, SSH, salinity, ocean color) Seasonal (outlook) Intra-annual to Decadal Multi-decadal (scenarios) Understanding Climate Impacts and Informing Adaptation Climate Impacts Research/Development Projections (modeling and downscaling) Ongoing Coastal Inundation/Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather, and Community Resilience Central North Pacific Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Ecosystems Community Planning and Development Public Health and Safety Social and Cultural Resources	f	f	Predicting the Impact of Storm Waves and Sea-Level Rise within the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument	f	t	The following products will be produced for both Midway Atoll and Laysan Island:\r\n1) Wave climatology (long-term characterization of wave patterns) delineating the different end-member wave conditions that impact the islands; 2) GIS maps of wave parameters (significant wave height, wave period, wavelength) for the different wave climatologies at present sea level; 3) GIS maps of wave parameters (significant wave height, wave period, wavelength) for the different wave climatologies at potential future sea levels; 4) GIS maps showing the limit of inundation for the different wave climatologies at present sea level relative to the locations of natural resources and infrastructure; 5) GIS maps showing the limit of inundation for the different wave climatologies at potential future sea levels relative to the locations of natural resources and infrastructure; and 6) Plots showing percentage of natural resources potentially inundated for the different wave climatologies at potential future sea levels.\r\nProducts generated will also utilize historic monitoring data collect by project cooperators were appropriate (NOAA, USFWS).\r\nThis project will also provide the essential baseline and understanding for potential future efforts to predict the potential effects of: a) tsunamis on natural and cultural resources; b) wave-induced forces on structures and predictions of coastal erosion and accretion; and c) sea-level rise’s influence on waves to better define impacts to Federally-managed marine resources (e.g., coral reefs).	t	U.S. Geological Survey, Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center	f	f	f	f	f	f	U.S. Geological Survey, Pacific Islands Ecological Research Center - Help conduct analyses, do visualization, and add terrestrial ecology to impact map products.	f	t	f	f	f	1) MSc. student support 2) USGS Open-File Report EPN publication charges	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	t	t	f	t	f	f	PnA_SLRPMNM.doc	t

The research phase, spanning March 2011 – May 2011 encompassed an initial literature review, interviews and surveys with local decision-makers, and development of an outline for the written product. In the writing phase, May 2011 – November 2011, a draft was completed and sent to stakeholder reviewers. The document was refined and published November 2011 – February 2012. Outreach to decision-makers continued in March 2012 – August 2012 with workshops, presentations, and media outreach.	In 2010, the Center for Island Climate Adaptation and Policy (ICAP) joined the Pacific Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (Pacific RISA) team and launched a project to assist governments in preparing and adopting cost-effective, efficient, and equitable adaptation measures. Pacific RISA integrates regional physical and social science to provide information and support for climate change adaptation initiatives in the Pacific Islands. \r\n\r\nICAP Senior Attorney, Richard Wallsgrove, working with other members of the ICAP team prepared an in-depth analysis of Hawaii’s law and policy framework for water resource management. That analysis identified twelve key tools and strategies for implementing adaptive water resource management in Hawaii. To minimize barriers to implementation, the proposed tools were designed to be consistent with the existing law and policy framework, and where possible, utilize existing models that have been tested in Hawaii or elsewhere. Research activities included detailed analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of available land-use and water resource planning mechanisms in Hawaii, the identification of adaptive water management strategies implemented in other jurisdictions and their applicability to Hawaii’s island setting, and the use of regulatory procedures or market-based mechanisms to enhance adaptive capacity. ICAP shared drafts of its analysis with local water experts and resource managers, and then incorporated their feedback into ICAP’s work product.  \r\n\r\nAs of March 2012, ICAP’s analysis is available in two forms: a full-length white paper and a condensed summary. Using those documents as a launching point, ICAP is proceeding with the next research phase of the project, which is to further engage water decision-makers, stakeholders, and legislators on the various Hawaiian Islands. The goals of that outreach are three-fold: (1) to identify priorities and barriers for implementing the recommended adaptive tools, in specific regard to each island setting; (2) to identify the most efficient and advantageous support that Pacific RISA can lend to the next steps of implementation; and (3) to educate regarding ICAP’s existing findings and recommendations. ICAP held outreach workshops on the island of Oahu in April and May 2012. After acquiring feedback from those events, ICAP held a subsequent workshop on Maui in July 2012. ICAP also intends to continue to identify platforms to broadcast its findings. For example, this includes a press release regarding the publication of ICAP’s report on adaptive resource management (April 2012), the publication of a modified version of its findings in an appropriate climate science/policy journal, and potential public information announcements on local radio.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Evaluation is a core activity of the Pacific RISA program. Lead by Susi Moser, an independent consultant and scientist, the team’s evaluation activities will assess the process, outputs, and outcomes of the Pacific RISA program. We plan a two-pronged but not sequential evaluation effort. The first prong will comprise an external evaluation of the role of Pacific RISA in progressing adaptation planning in Hawaii and constitute a discrete project. We will focus on Hawaii in part for logistical and cost reasons but also because Hawaii is where much of our initial work on integrating biophysical and social science and indigenous/local knowledge will take place. In addition, we will develop self-evaluation criteria to be administered in each year of the program and use the findings to refine our goals and methods region-wide.	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	 Understanding Climate Impacts and Informing Adaptation Climate Adaptation Training and Capacity Building, Education, Outreach Best Practices/Guidance Decision Support Tools Policies and Legislation Public Health and Safety Fresh Water Resources Community Planning and Development Social and Cultural Resources Agriculture and Fisheries Ongoing Fresh Water Resources and Drought Central North Pacific State of Hawaii	f	f	Pacific RISA Climate Adaptation Law and Policy Analysis	f	f	1) Analyze the application of Hawaii’s current regulations and policies, including the 1987 Hawaii State Water Code and resulting water plans, that control the allocation, supply, infrastructure, maintenance and monitoring of water use in Hawaii, with the goals to understand and measure the ways in which the current framework addresses—or fails to address—the need to implement water resource management strategies with the ability to adapt to climate-driven vulnerabilities in Hawaii’s water system. 2) Present the legal analysis and adaptive tools developed in Year 1 and gather feedback through a series of workshops to ground truth the findings with focused groups of stakeholders. 3) Assist stakeholders in implementing select adaptive tools and overcome perceived legal and technical hurdles to allow the tools to be used effectively. 4) Refine the stakeholder-driven research methods and apply similar methods to develop case studies for other island locations, such as a neighbor island in Hawaii and a location in Guam, American Samoa or another USAPI. 5) Make the findings of the white paper, Water Resources and Climate Change Adaptation in Hawaii: Adaptive Tools in the Current Law and Policy Framework, available to Hawaii community members, other Pacific Island and U.S. jurisdictions, as well as the climate change and policy research communities.	t	Center for Island Climate Adaptation and Policy (ICAP)	f	f	f	f	f	f	The East West Center is the lead institution for Pacific RISA, Phase II.

Species abundance models can then be applied to adjusted climate landscapes in concert with ongoing climate model downscaling efforts. Additional data on growth, reproductive, and dispersal rates of focal species will inform the rates of different species transitions.

An established systematic and standardize tool currently used to monitor biodiversity in the Pacific is the Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structure (ARMS). ARMS were developed by the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center’s Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) as part of the Census of Marine Life’s Census of Coral Reefs project. ARMS are a long-term collecting device designed to mimic the structural complexity of a coral reef and attract colonizing invertebrates. Through taxonomic identification and mass sequencing technologies they provide a consistent and comparable method to measure and monitor the biodiversity of these understudied organisms over time. They enhance ecosystem-based management and increase the ability to monitor and predict ecological impacts in response to natural and anthropogenic stressors. In conjunction with measured climatic variables such as temperature and salinity, ARMS could help advance our understanding of the relationship between climate variables and biodiversity. Currently, over 500 ARMS units are placed strategically throughout the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans with the majority at sites in the Pacific. To help facilitate the data produced from each ARMS unit, an ARMSbase web-enabled biodiversity information system has been proposed. The ARMSbase would house all information related to the ARMS which would include all metadata related to deployment, retrieval, and processing as well as the raw taxonomic and molecular sequence information. This information can then be applied and related to physical climate variables collected across the Pacific to investigate the relationships between biodiversity and Pacific climate trends.	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	Availability of raw, in-process, and summarized data products from ARMS deployed in the Pacific and beyond.	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Understanding Climate Variability and Change Observing Systems, Data Stewardship, Data Services Research/Development Sub-surface (e.g., temp, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Proposed Marine and Terrestrial Ecosystems State of Hawaii Central North Pacific Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Western North Pacific Guam Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) Republic of Palau American Samoa South Pacific	f	f	Monitoring Marine Biodiversity in the Pacific Islands	f	f	1) Construct ARMSbase web-enabled biodiversity information system; 2) Advance our understanding of biodiversity changes in relationship to climate variables.	f	NOAA/PIFSC/CRED, JIMAR	f	f	f	f	f	t	1) Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Australian Institute of Marine Science, and NOAA/PIFSC/Coral Reef Ecosystem Division will provide input to and feedback on the ARMSbase data model.
